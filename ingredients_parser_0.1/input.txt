IDEAS:

Does not have to be perfect, just good enough. 
Shitty pictures give shitty results and it is what it is - just give them a chance to add words.
The OCR likely has bounding boxes which show what part of the text was used, include that for missed words, if any. 








Hello, I want to build a product ingredient parser in Python. Lets start very simple, with minimal amount of functions and parameters.

So far it converts an image to text and then parses the ingredients, searching for each ingredient in a website. 

I have some simple code for trying to find the best match but its quite rudimentary. 

For instance, when searching for "Aqua" it outputs all of these results:

MARIS AQUA

MENTHA AQUATICA (WATER MINT) LEAF EXTRACT

APHANIZOMENON FLOSAQUAE EXTRACT

AQUAMARINE POWDER

ALISMA PLANTAGO AQUATICA EXTRACT

PARAQUAT DICHLORIDE

None of these are purely 'Aqua' so it should simply omit them and return None. 

An other case is when the image2text generator combines two words, like this:

"Alcohol Denat. Butyl Methoxydiben- zoylmethane"

The two ingredients are:

"Alcohol Denat." which is actually "Alcohol Denatured" 

and

"Butyl Methoxydiben- zoylmethane" which is actually "Butyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane" BUT when searching for it on the website it reurns "Butylphenyl Methoxydibenzoylmethane"

 

So its a somewhat complex problem and we've determined a few types of errors.

Ingredient list: Can have abbreviated words. 

Image2Text is not always accurate, combining or omitting ingredients or just plainly outputting the wrong word/letters.

The website Search Engine does not list the desired ingredient or outputs similar ingredients which are very similar but not quite correct and thus should be omitted. 

I believe Ive identified possible solutions to this issue.
